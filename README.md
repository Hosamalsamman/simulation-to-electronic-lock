SMART DOOR LOCK

Â· Using ATMega32 MCU, a 3x3 keypad and an EEPROM I designed and implemented a closed loop system that can be connected to any regular door to lock it with a password code. The system can edit or remove password by the authorized user, or locks it for 30 minutes if a wrong password is written 3 times in 5 minutes.
